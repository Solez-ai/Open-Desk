# OpenDesk WebRTC Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Screen Sharing Not Showing on Controller** ✅
**Problem**: When host starts screen sharing, the video doesn't appear on controller's screen.

**Root Causes**:
- WebRTC tracks not properly added before creating offers
- Video element not properly updated when remote stream changes
- Timing issues in the offer/answer flow

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added tracks to peer connection BEFORE creating offers
- Enhanced `ontrack` event handler with better debugging
- Added forced video element update with timeout
- Improved renegotiation flow to ensure tracks are added
- Added data attributes to video elements for easier debugging

### 2. **Native Agent Popup Issue** ✅
**Problem**: Always showing "Native Agent Not Found" popup with browser simulation message.

**Root Causes**:
- `LocalAgentAdapter.init()` always returned `false`
- Popup was shown in production mode

**Solutions Applied**:
- Modified `LocalAgentAdapter` to return `true` in development mode
- Made popup only show in development mode
- Improved error messages to be less intrusive

### 3. **WebRTC Connection Flow Issues** ✅
**Problem**: Peer connections not properly established between host and controller.

**Root Causes**:
- Tracks added after offer creation
- Insufficient debugging information
- Timing issues in connection establishment

**Solutions Applied**:
- Ensured tracks are added before creating offers
- Added comprehensive debugging component
- Improved connection state monitoring
- Enhanced logging throughout the WebRTC flow

## Debug Tools Added

### WebRTCDebug Component
- Real-time connection state monitoring
- Stream track information
- Peer connection status
- Data channel state
- Accessible via debug button in bottom-right corner

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. **Host Screen Sharing Test**
1. Join as host
2. Click "Start Screen Share"
3. Verify no popup appears (in production)
4. Check debug panel shows local stream with video track

### 2. **Controller Connection Test**
1. Join as controller after host has started sharing
2. Verify remote stream appears in debug panel
3. Check that video element shows the host's screen
4. Verify data channel is open

### 3. **WebRTC Flow Test**
1. Open browser dev tools console
2. Look for detailed logging of:
   - Track addition
   - Offer/answer creation
   - Connection state changes
   - Stream assignment

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Video Still Not Showing
**Check**:
1. Browser console for errors
2. Debug panel for connection states
3. Network tab for WebRTC signaling
4. Ensure both users are in the same session

### Issue: Connection Fails
**Check**:
1. ICE connection state in debug panel
2. Signaling state progression
3. Firewall/NAT issues
4. STUN/TURN server availability

### Issue: Tracks Not Transmitted
**Check**:
1. Local stream has video track
2. Tracks added before offer creation
3. Renegotiation completed successfully
4. Remote peer receives tracks

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

### Required Permissions
- Screen capture permission
- Camera/microphone (if audio enabled)
- WebRTC peer connections

## Performance Optimization

### Video Quality Settings
- Default: 1920x1080 @ 30fps
- Adaptive bitrate based on connection quality
- Automatic quality adjustment

### Connection Monitoring
- Real-time quality indicators
- Automatic reconnection on failure
- Bandwidth usage monitoring

## Development vs Production

### Development Mode
- Debug panel enabled
- Detailed console logging
- Native agent simulation
- Toast notifications for debugging

### Production Mode
- Minimal logging
- No debug popups
- Optimized performance
- Clean user experience

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** with multiple users
2. **Monitor performance** in production
3. **Collect feedback** on user experience
4. **Optimize** based on real-world usage

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Use debug panel to identify connection issues
3. Verify network connectivity
4. Test with different browsers
5. Check firewall/NAT configuration
